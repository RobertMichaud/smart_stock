# How to run this starter app
1. Make sure that you have npm, version 10.x installed on your machine. <br></br>
2. Make sure that you have dotnet core, version 3.1 installed on your machine. <br></br>
3. Install the Angular CLI on your machine, with `npm install -g @angular/cli`. <br></br>
4. `cd` into the "ClientApp" directory, and run `npm install`. <br></br>
5. `cd ..` into the previous directory with the `smart_stock.csproj` file, and execute `dotnet run`. It will take a moment for the C# and JS code to compile, as this is technically compiling two different packages of code. <br></br>
6. READ the comments and any additional documentation you may need, this is complicated stuff, and the school doesn't teach a lot of this to us.
